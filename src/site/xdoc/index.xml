      Jolokia is a JMX-HTTP bridge giving an alternative to JSR-160
      connectors.  It is an agent based approach with support for many
      platforms. In addition to basic JMX operations it enhances JMX
      remoting with unique features like bulk requests and fine grained
      security policies.

        <div class="news-date">2011-10-03</div>
        <p>
          It's time to celebrate: After two and half years of hard
          work, Jmx4Perl and Jolokia have been all wrapped up for
          their 1.0 releases.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last month the focus was on hardening this first
          official release. This effort is backed up by these numbers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            216 integration tests which has been successfully run on
            <a href="agent.html">38</a> different platforms.
          </li>
          <li>
            a unit test coverarge of 82.7% with 404 Java and 194
            Javascript unit tests.  
          </li>
          <li>
            a <a
            href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Technical+Debt+Calculation">technical
            debt</a> of 2% (or 8 man day) as measured by <a
            href="http://www.sonarsource.org">Sonar</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            other Sonar metrics inlcuding:
            <ul>
              <li>
                100% rule compliance
              </li>
              <li>
                0% package tangle index
              </li>
              <li>34.1% comments and 100% documented API</li>
              <li>94.6% total quality</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The detailed code metrics can be examined on <a href="http://labs.consol.de/sonar/dashboard/index/org.jolokia:jolokia">Jolokia's
          Sonar Dashboard</a> and it's evolution over time is
          documented in the <a href="http://labs.consol.de/sonar/timemachine/index/946">time machine</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm very confident that this 1.0.0 version is rock solid
          and production ready.
        </p>
        <p>
          There has been a minor protocol change for the way how
          Jolokia does URL escaping for slashes within GET requests,
          though. This scheme is not backwards compatible to the
          pre-1.0 protocol (which used a different, more complicated
          algorithm). Clients need to be updated, which has been
          already done for Jmx4Perl 1.00 and of course Jolokia 1.0.0's
          Javascript und Java client libraries.  Since Jolokia is out
          of beta now such kind of change won't happen in this ad-hoc
          manner in the future, promised.

          conference which I greatly enjoyed as visitor in the
          past. 30 minutes are surely not long enough for getting in

          The second conference where Jolokia will play its role this
          autumn is at the Open Source Monitoring Conference "<a

          Java monitoring with Jmx4Perl and Jolokia</a>" in Nuremberg
          on November 30th 2011. It's a quite different talk with
          focus on Jmx4Perl, discovery of relevant monitoring metrics
          and it's configuration in a Nagios environment. Not much
          Java here, but tooling en masse. I'm really looking forward
          to this home play, too.

      <subsection name="Summer break is over and 0.95 is here">
        <div class="news-date">2011-08-21</div>        
        <p>
          The summer break is over and Jolokia is one step closer to
          1.0. Germans might reasonably argue, 'ehm, what summer do
          you talk about ?' but at least 0.95 is a fact and introduces
          two new features. Very cool features, IMO.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Jolokia <a href="agent/jvm.html">JVM Agent</a> is
          now able to use the <a
          href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/jdk/api/attach/spec/com/sun/tools/attach/VirtualMachine.html">Java
          Attach API</a> so that it is possible to dynamically attach
          and detach a Jolokia agent to a running Java process, much
          like <a
          href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/management/jconsole.html">jconsole</a>. It
          is a really exciting and powerful feature, because it allows
          for HTTP/JSON access without (permanently) instrumenting a
          Java process by deploying an agent or modifying startup
          options, which is a major obstacle for quite some users. The
          nice advantage over <code>jconsole</code> is that it
          attaches <em>locally</em> but export the data
          <em>remotely</em>. Perfect for headless server
          installations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second addition is the support for upstream
          serialization of all <a
          href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/management/openmbean/OpenType.html">OpenType</a>
          types so that JMX operations and write requests can be used
          with <code>OpenTypes</code>, too. For <a
          href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/management/MXBean.html">MXBeans</a>
          special support has been added, so that e.g. a JSON map gets
          properly translated to an MXBean's Map attribute (which in
          between gets translated to a <a
          href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/management/openmbean/TabularData.html">TabularData</a>
          with a fixed format). Since MXBeans are so easy to declare,
          implement and register, this missing piece really adds to
          our <em>JMX on Capsaicin</em> mantra.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both features arrived via GitHub <a
          href="https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/pulls">pull
          requests</a> and are proofs for the relevance of the social
          coding model introduced by GitHub. Big acknowlegdments go
          out to <a href="https://github.com/asssaf">Assaf Berg</a>
          and <a href="https://github.com/GregBowyer">Greg Bowyer</a>
          for providing pull requests which lead to these features.
