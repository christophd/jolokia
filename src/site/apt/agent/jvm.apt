JVM Agent

  Another variant is Jolokia's JVM agent which does not need any special container
  environment. The only dependency is on Oracle's JDK 6 or later as runtime,
  since it contains a lightweight HTTP Server used for
  exporting the Jolokia protocol. This agent is the most generic one which can
  instrument <any> Java application using a JDK6. It is suitable for
  situations where the other agents don't fit. Also, it can be used for dynamically
  attaching an agent to a running Java process.

  For using this agent, the following argument to the Java
  application to instrument has to be given:

-----
  -javaagent:/path/to/jolokia-jvm-<version>-agent.jar
-----

  By default, the agent will listen on port 8778, but this can be configured
  as well as other aspects like authentication:

  * Provide options on the commandline as key-value pairs:

----
  -javaagent:agent.jar=port=7777,host=localhost
----

  * Via a properties file

----
  -javaagent:agent.jar=config=/path/to/config.properties
----

  * Via packaging a jolokia-agent.properties top level in the agent.jar

  []

  Options are used in the given precedence, the former overwriting
  the later values.

  For attaching the agent dynamically to a running Java process, the following
  command can be used to get a quick help

----
  java -jar /path/to/jolokia-jvm-<version>-agent.jar --help
----
